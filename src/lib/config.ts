 *  CREATOR REPOS — Central source of truth for GitHub repo display
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  These are the repositories of the DannFlow creator (Danncode10).
 *  They appear in two places:
 *    1. Landing page → Features > GitHub MCP tab
 *    2. Dashboard → Version Control Context tab
 *
 *  ⚙️  WANT TO SHOW YOUR OWN REPOS?
 *  Replace the list below with your own projects.
 *  Prompt your coding AI with:
 *
 *    "Use the GitHub MCP to fetch all public repos for <your-github-username>,
 *     pick the 20 most interesting ones (with descriptions), and update the
 *     creatorRepos array in src/lib/config.ts. Each entry needs:
 *     { name, url, description }"
 *
 *  Then update NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_URL in your .env.local to your own GitHub profile.
